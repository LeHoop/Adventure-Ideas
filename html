    <p id="intro">After growing up in San Diego, I have come by a few favorite places to eat and things to do. 
        <br>These may not be top picks on "things to do in San Diego" websites, but they are on my favorite list.
        <br> I hope you are able to enjoy some if not all of the activities and eateries listed.</p>

    <div id="activityDetails"></div>
    <div id="activityDetails"><p>Before parking, or after, head into town and rent some snorkel gear (walking distance)<br>
                                Once on the beach, walk to the south end and head into the water. If you are a strong swimmer, or the tide is not too crazy, you can swim all the way to the coves.<br>
                                There are also guided tours by kayak that will take you out to the coves and into a cave if the tide is right!<br>
                                In the warmer months, there will be a high chance for observing the non aggressive leopard sharks! They are the reason I own my own snorkel gear!</p></div>

                                My wife and I love the water side stroll to get to the slots.<br>
                                We usually go through the slots twice before heading back.<br>
                                If you would like to explore a not very populated beach afterwards, head to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eb1YKtvsbSWa2eQc7"> this</a> spot.

    <div id="activityDetails"></div>
    <div id="activityDetails"><p>I have fully enjoyed finding this place! From stand up paddle boards, to jet skis, or even my favorite choice, a sail boat!<br>
                                Experience sailing is not needed. In fact, you will find it surprising how incredibly quick you pick it up!<br>
                                For a low cost, you can rent a sail boat and have all of mission bay covered in less than an hour.</p></div>

    <div id="activityDetails"><p>For zoo lovers, this place is great! You will be in the sun, so don't forget your sun block, a hat, and water!<br>
                                Aside from the animals, and the safari tram guide, I hope you are lucky enough to visit on a day that The Watering Hole is open.<br>
                                The picture above shows the dining area overlooking the field where you can see a variety of animals grazing on grass as you graze on your delicious meal.</p></div>

    <div id="activityDetails"><p>Just because the sun is down, does not mean your day needs to be over!<br>
                                The ferry landing has been for many years one of my favorite night spots for taking in the view of Downtown, or even a nice stroll in the night air.<br>
                                If you would like to get a little more out of the experience check out the ferry <a href="https://www.flagshipsd.com/ferry-routes/broadway-pier"> schedule</a> and book a round trip.<br>

    <div id="activityDetails"><p>More after sun down serenity! Walk the beach at night to the sounds of the waves crashing at your side.<br>
                                If you get lucky, you may stumble upon the military running training near and in the water!<br>
                                Observe the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_del_Coronado"> Hotel Del</a> lit up in the distance as you draw closer to it. You can even walk through it and appreciate this architectural beauty! </p></div>
